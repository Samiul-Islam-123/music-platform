## üöÄ Installation

This project uses a client-server architecture. You need to set up both the client and server independently.

cd music-platform
```

**2. Client-Side Installation:**

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

**3. Server-Side Installation:**

```bash
cd ../server
npm install
```

cd server
npm start
```

**2. Start the Client:**
